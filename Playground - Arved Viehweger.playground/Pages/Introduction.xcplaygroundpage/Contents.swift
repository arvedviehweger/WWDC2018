 ### Overview
 
 This playground was inspired by my hobby - Amateur Radio and satellite communication ðŸ“¡. We will specifically focus on weather satellites and how Low Earth Orbiting Satellites (in short LEO Satellites) orbit around the world. You will also learn what the data transmission signal sounds like and how the satellite looks like. But most important, you will learn about the **Swift** programming language! I hope you have fun! ðŸ˜„
 
 - Important:
 *This playground is targeted at people who have a very basic knowledge of the swift programming language.*
 
 You can find the basic code for **this** page down here:

let Scene = SatelliteScene()
Scene.setupScene()
PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = Scene

- Note:
 **You don't have to change anything on this page, we will start modyfying the code on the next page.** ðŸ˜‰

 You probably discovered the satellite on the right half of your screen by now. My assistant Siri will give you a short explaination about ***NOAA-19***. Rotate the satellite with your mouse to carefully inspect it. ðŸ›° Once you've seen enough, feel free to press the "Next page" button down below.
